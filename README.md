## Deep Learning for Discovery of Transcription Factor Binding Sites in DNA
## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning algorithms to identify transcription factor binding sites within DNA sequences. By analyzing sequences and their respective labels, the model learns to predict the presence of binding sites, providing insights into gene regulation mechanisms.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Requests
Getting Started
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can then install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests scikit-learn tensorflow
## Data Preparation
The DNA sequences and their labels are fetched from public repositories using the requests library. Sequences are one-hot encoded to represent each base (A, C, G, T) as a binary vector, suitable for model input.

## Model Training
A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is defined and trained on the processed sequences to classify them based on the presence of transcription factor binding sites. The model includes convolutional, max pooling, flattening, and dense layers, optimized using the binary cross-entropy loss function.

## Evaluation
The trained model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, and its accuracy and loss are visualized over epochs for both training and validation sets.

## Saliency Analysis
To understand which bases contribute most to the model's predictions, a saliency map is generated for selected sequences. This highlights the bases that have the highest impact on the model's classification decision.

## Usage
Fetch and Prepare Data: Run the initial code blocks to download the DNA sequences and their labels, followed by preprocessing steps to one-hot encode the sequences.

Model Definition and Training: Execute the model definition and training code. Adjust the number of epochs as needed based on the desired accuracy and computational resources.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the provided code to generate a confusion matrix and plot training/validation loss and accuracy.

Saliency Map Generation: Generate saliency maps for selected DNA sequences to interpret the model's behavior and identify key bases influencing the predictions.
